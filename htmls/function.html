        <h1>Problem Statement-</h1>
        <p>
            Managing urban water distribution networks is challenging due to rising demand, uneven
pressure, leakage, and high operational costs. Manual monitoring is inefficient, making it
essential to automate the design and optimization of pipeline networks. This project
focuses on ensuring cost-effective, consistent, and sustainable water distribution across a
city.

                    The module is about designing and improving a water pipeline system. It helps estimate water needs, plan pipeline routes, maintain proper pressure, and reduce costs. The data includes house IDs, locations, and pipeline costs. The process includes creating the network, calculating water demand, adjusting pressure, and handling complaints, all using graph algorithms like MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) and shortest path.

                <th>
                    The main pain points in this module include the complexity of designing an efficient pipeline system that balances cost, pressure, and coverage. Maintaining consistent water pressure across all houses, especially with fluctuating demand, is another challenge. Additionally, handling complaints about issues like low pressure or leaks can be time-consuming. To improve the system, we need to better understand how water demand changes, the impact of geography on pipeline routing, and how to balance cost with performance. The key challenges are optimizing pipeline routes, ensuring proper pressure, and efficiently addressing complaints.
